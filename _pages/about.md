I am Member of Technical Staff working at VMware Softwares Pvt. Ltd., Pune since July '19. Previously I used to work as a Software Engineer at Samsung Research Institute, Noida. I completed my B.Tech from [IIT Kanpur](https://iitk.ac.in/) majoring in Computer Science and Engineering with minor in Microelectronics. I am interested in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Systems more specifically kernels.

I come from a city of history in Maharastra called Aurangabad. In my free time I love to listen to classic rock music, binge watch TV shows, movies and of course Cricket.
